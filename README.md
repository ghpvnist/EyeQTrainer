# EyeQTrainer 🧠
This is a rework of my original EyeQTrainer Java version into Kotlin. 

What is EyeQTrainer? 👀
- 🎨 EyeQTrainer is a game where users pick out a color that is different from the rest. 
- 🧩 The game gets progressively harder with less color difference between the rest and more squares to choose from. 
- 🌈 There are 145 colors in the game to test yourself on!
- ⭐️ Available for free on Google Play [here!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gpdev.eyeqtrainer) 
- 🌅 Supports landscape mode!

Future Goals:
- ⚙️ Integrate a system to see a graph of personalized data of which colors the user sees the best and worst. 
- ⚙️ Integrate a system to suggest colors that the user frequently misses to improve accuracy. 
- ⚙️ Integrate different game modes to allow testing for colorblindness.
