# EyeQTrainer
This is a rework of my original EyeQTrainer Java version into Kotlin. 

What is EyeQTrainer?
- EyeQTrainer is a game where users pick out a color that is different from the rest. 
The game gets progressively harder with less color difference between the rest and more squares to choose from. 

Future Goals:
- Integrate a system to see a graph of personalized data of which colors the user sees the best and worst. 
- Integrate a system to suggest colors that the user frequently misses to improve accuracy. 
- Integrate different game modes to allow testing for colorblindness.
